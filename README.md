# Design Patterns Overview

This document provides a detailed overview of key design patterns utilized in software development. Understanding these patterns enhances code organization, promotes reusability, and improves maintainability. Below are descriptions of each creational pattern, highlighting their purposes and use cases.

## Creational Patterns

### 1. Factory Method

The Factory Method pattern is centered around creating objects without explicitly specifying the exact class of the object that will be instantiated. Instead, a creator class defines a method that returns new instances of a product. This approach promotes loose coupling, allowing the client to work with interfaces rather than concrete classes. It also provides flexibility, enabling subclasses to alter the type of objects created based on specific needs.

### 2. Abstract Factory

The Abstract Factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is particularly beneficial in scenarios where a system needs to be independent of how its products are created, composed, or represented. It ensures consistency among products by encapsulating the creation logic, allowing systems to be easily extended with new families of products without modifying existing code.

### 3. Builder

The Builder pattern focuses on constructing complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a product from its representation, enabling the same construction process to create different representations of an object. This pattern is useful when an object requires multiple configurations or when the construction process involves intricate steps that should be managed independently from the final object.

### 4. Prototype

The Prototype pattern facilitates the creation of new objects by copying an existing object, known as a prototype. This pattern is advantageous when the cost of creating a new instance of an object is higher than the cost of copying an existing one. By using prototyping, systems can instantiate new objects dynamically at runtime, enabling efficient resource utilization and promoting the reuse of existing objects.

### 5. Singleton

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful in scenarios where a single instance is required to coordinate actions across the system. The pattern restricts instantiation of a class to a single object, which can help in managing shared resources and preventing issues related to multiple instances.
